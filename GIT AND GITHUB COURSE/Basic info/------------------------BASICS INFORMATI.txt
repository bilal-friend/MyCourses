------------------------BASICS INFORMATIONS-----------------------------

GIT : is Distruted version control system
GitHub is Source for your Project
note : you can use Git without GitHub

What can I do with them : - it saves every stage of Project devlopment and sure you
go back to any stage that you want it {version}

           - Git has GUI and CLI
           - Group work (devs contribute to the same project) ,

(you can revert changes ) (you can see all modifiction of you team)

           - you can collaborate (for you project)

           - make an organized project {every feature has a comment}

---------------------------- TERMS--------------------------------------

Repository : 
Branch : from repo
Local Repo :
Remote Repo :
Commit :
clone :
push :
pull :
pull Request :

------------------------Imorotant Notes --------------------------------

- Create Repository for Every Project
- Create A New Branch for Every feature or enhacement
- Anyone Can Push and Pull Depend on Permissions
------------------let's start ----------------------------------------------

git init : for create you Local Repo and knows Git know that it should watch
the files that is init , and sure Git is aware of any file , so if you are
create a file , this file is here but it is not included to you Repository

soooo iles in you Repo can be one of 2 states :
--Tracked : files that Git knows about and added to your Repo
-- Untracked : files that are on you working directory , but not added to 
you Reppo and for get Git track them you have to stage them 

-------------------------- stage
one of the core functions of Git is the concepts of the staging Environment
and the commit . as you are working , you may be adding, editing and removig 
files .but whenever you hit a milestone 'principle ' or finish a part of
the work , you add the file to a staging Environment 
==we use --all instead of filenames and shorthand is git add -A

-------------------------- commit
- NOW IF you finshed the work and you are satisfied with the content of 
the file added so you are ready to move from stage to commit 
adding commits keep track of our progrees and changes , Git considers each
commit change point or "save point" , it is a point in the project you can 
go back to if you find a bug or want to make change , and when we commit 
we should always include a message for make it easy for others and ouselves 
for se what has changes and when .... $$git commit -m "message"
**-Commit without stage for changed files you can use -a option

------------- GIT Branch
Branches allow tou to work on differnt parts of a project without impacting
the main branch , and when the work is completed , a branch can be merged 
with the main branch and you can even switch between them and work 
on different projects , sooo for create a branch $$ git branch branch-name$$
for see the branches $$git branch 

the * beside a branch mean that you are in it currently 

$$ git checkout: used to check out a branch .Moving us from the current 
branch to the one specified at the end of the command , and sure our 
workspace will move with us sure if the file not commited yet

NOTE : using -b option will create a new branch and move to it ,if it don't exit
git branch -d branch-name : for delete branch that its content is merged
git branch -D branch-name : for delete by force although its content isn't merged
git branch -m new-name : for renmae you current branch
if you finish you task using another brach you have 2choice 1.merge you branch with main or
push you branch then pull request that its link apear in line command

------------------- GIT BRANCH MERGE 
if you want to update a web-site style , you can ruin "tkharb" all the code
so be smart and crate another branch  $$ git branch -d : for delete branch

------------------ ADD A REMOTE TO YOU  LOCAL 
# git remote add origin URL : spcifies that you are adding a remote repo , with 
the specified URL , as an origin to you local git repo

--------------------------------- PULLING TO KEEP UP-TO-DATE WITH changes
when working as a team on a project , it is important that everyone stays up to date 
Any time you start working on a project , you should get the most recent changes to your
local copy . with Git , you can do that with pull
PULL is a combination of 2 different commands : 
                 * fetch
                 *merge
-------------FETCH =======> # git fetch remote-name
git fetch get changes from remote to you local repo {not to you workspace}
---- Git Diff => for showing the differnces between our local and remote 
                 syntax : git diff remote-name/local-repo-name -color red : new changes 
                                                         -color green : the old content

----------MERGE -------------> # git fetch remote-name/local-repo-name
git merge get changes from local repo to working directory
---------------- PULL # git pull remote-name
like we said pull combine between fetch and merge , so pull used to pull all changes from
Remote to working directory {go by local repo sure}

----------------------- GIT PUSH = for push changes to GitHub from local to remote 
                                  syntax : git push remote-name
--------------------CREATE NEW BRANCH ON GitHub
click on main then enter name of new-branch the click on create {for remote branch}
* local branch : is a branch the only you can see . it exits only on you local machine 
* Remote branch : is a branch on the remote . and all team can track it 
note : git branch : -l for see all local branchs
                    -r for see all remote branchs 
                  -a option for see all the branchs local and remote

----------------------- PULL Request
PULL REQUEST : tell team that you have modifictions and you send this request for demand 
the team to pull you changes to the main branch at the remote and we use it in: 
For example , you work in a comany , and you task is adding a feature by javascript and 
you included in team so you will clone the repo and add a new branch then you will work in it 
then you will push to the fork repo then you will send the pull request and then the admin see
the you addition and decide if it will be merged or not , it depend , and then you can delete
the branch or the fork (because you finished you work) , when you are sending pull request 
pay attention add check "allow edits from maintaners" for make the admin able to edit content

----------------------------------SSH 
we use HTTPS to connect to our remote repo . HTTPS will usually work just fiine . but 
you should use SSH if you work with unsecured networks . and sometimes, a project will require
that you use SSH , and we use it instead of username and password writting every time SSH give
the machine our indentity and tell the machine who are us for create a SSH key : 
{# ssh-keygen} then continue and sure there is passphrase you can protect you key by. this command
will create for you 2keys the first is private key {id_rsa} and second is a public one that 
you share it with the remote prat {id_rsa.pub} and then you should copy the public key and paste
it in remote repo (you can copy it - cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub - or go to the file and use cat )
and for test that are you successfully authenticated'mwtk msdk" use{#git config -T git@github.com}
if the last line contain you username on github so you are successfully authenticated 
-c option for comment and you must do any you address emial

----------------------------GIT CONFIGURITION
git config --list {-l for shorthand} for show all configuration .and the terminal bring 
the inforamtion for different places and for be sure try{git config -l --show-origin} .
we have 2 type of config the first is local that contain info for a specific repo and 
there is global that contain global INFORMATIONS . for open manuel of configuriton
{# git hlep config} . and for edit  configuration . take an example 
{# git config --global user.name "new user-name} applied this for all configuration and for revert 
and delete or unset an information you have 2ways  the first {git config --gobal user.email ""}
and the second is { git config --global --unset user.name} , and we have another way to edit config
{# git config --global --edit} this will open an editor and you can modifed the configuration by it
and for choice the editor that you want it to open it {# git config --global core.editor editor name 
or the path for arrive at it } note : -e is shorthand for --edit . if you open the editor you 
can modified many things like color of status " [color "status"] added=blue Untracked= yellow .."

------------------ MULTIPLE SSH ON ONE COMPUTER {BIG PROBLEME}
SOLUTION :  create 2 ssh in the same folder one of these keys you will add something to 
indentity file from config that you will create it and sure don't forget to add a comment 
using # for write the name of the github account {write anything you want it just a comment,
then add ssh-key to agent 1.start ssh-agent in backround{eval `ssh-agent -s`}and now 
 you can add shh{ssh-add}, and when you are doing clone for second account you have to
change somthing {git remote add origin git@host:kml }
{the comment should be difrrent / priviate key add agent}
------------------------Aliases
For create an Aliases {git config --global alias.abbreviation origin-command} , and you can 
see your aliases and edit it by config
--------------------------------------- STASH
git stash is a temporarily stashing or hiding in shelves or boxes, for add files to stash first
you have to add files to staging Environment then{git stash}, use{git stash list}for see you boxes
and use git pop for dropp or remove file form box or use apply for get a copy for file and don'T
get it out ,when you drop or apply a file direcly the first file that will recieve the command
so for specifie take this { git stash pop stash@{5} } , use{git stash drop} for delete a box and 
all the content will be deleted, and use{git stash clear} for delete all boxes,use {git stash show}
for see changes
--------------------------------------Restore and Clean
for unstage a file you have 2 methods first is CLI {git resore --stage file-name} and the second 
GUI sure using vs in source control{ctr-shift-G}, we use clean for delete all files, we use -n for
show the filles that will be deleted and use -f option for delete filles, and for consereve a file
it's enough to stage it 
---------------------------------RESETTING THE HEAD 
Head : pointer that refer to the last commit
if you want to delete a recent commit so you must to remove the head from the bad commit to 
the good commit because all the commit that are after head well be removes using reset, so for 
restet the head{git reset --hard good_commit-id}
git log for see all commits and their inforamtions

---------------------------------IGNORING FILES AND DIRECTORIES
we use git ignor for ignoring some files that you need it in your working-space and it's not 
included in project so you have to tell system about this,first create .gitignore then open it,
for ignore files,use file name for ignore or use *file_extension for ignore any file with this 
extension,use !file_name for except a file,use directory_name for ignore of dir files, and use
caractre_how_the_file_begin with * for igore the fille that begin with

-------------------------------------TAGGING AND RELEASING
 1. lightweigt tag : take comment from commit comment for add it {git tag tag_name}
 2. annotated tag : you can write you personel comment {git tag -a tag-name -m "comment}
 for see all you tags {git tag or git tag -l} for serch a tag {git tag -l "v1.*} here we search 
 for all tags that begin with v1. /
For push a tag {git push origin tag-name}, when you push a tag so all project stop here and if
you add , all modification will be saved in another version, for delete a tag 1.you need to 
delete it localy {git tag -d tag-name} and for deleted then from remote 
{git push origin -d tag-name},and releasing is like tag , we use release for add notes for 
lightweigt tag
------------------------- Git Commit --amend
we use it for change the most recent commit message 
$$ git commit --amend -m "New commit message" and then push using force option
{git push -f origin main}
------------------------------Change Commit message
git rebase -i HEAD~N , where N is the number of commits, if you want to change the 4th
and 5th latest commits, you would type $$ git rebase -i HEAD~5 that will show you all
latest 5 commits, and this command will open an editor 3. move to lines that contain
the old comment and replace pick with reword then save and close editor , this command
will also open an editor that in it you can change the comment , then as usual push 
with force option 
o change the most recent commit message, use the git commit --amend command. 
To change older or multiple commit messages, use git rebase -i HEAD~N.
triks : don't amend push commits because that will cause a lot of problems to you
colleges <may be> amend= fix or modify or improve


git--version : for get which version of git is installed

===== for tell Git who are you $$ git config --global user.name"jdo" and 
$$git config --global user.email "bb@gld"
note : use global to set email and user-name for every Repo on you computer
If you want to set e-mail or username for just the current Repo , you can 
remove --global
git status : for check the status of the Git and --short optint will show
you the info in more impact way and useg a flages
?? - Untracked files
A - Files added to stage
M - Modified files
D - Deleted files
-------------- Git log ; for see the history of commits for you Repo
FOR HELP : if you are having touble remembering commands or options for 
commands, you can use Git help , the are a couple of different ways you can
use the help command is command line :
  1. git command -help : see all available options for the specific command
  2. Git help --all: see all possible command
Warnig: this will display a very long list of commands , so if you find 
        yourself stuck'alik' in the list view , SHIFT + G to jump the end 
        of the list the Q to exit the view 
CTR+F : for search in a website
git push -u origin master {for pull and then push}
-----------------------For delete files form remote
first delete them from local repo by delete and commit then push changes . it's easy
